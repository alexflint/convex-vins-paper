\section{Results}

Simulation results, with comparison to Mourikis. Could also compare to

- optimize from zero

- stationary initialization

- linear solution for camera positions without using IMU terms at all

- robust vs non-robust version

Rolling shutter results with/without rolling shutter model?

Results on a small number of real-world datasets. The right thing to look at here is how many converged vs how many did not converge.
